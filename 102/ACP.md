tis an important cycle for any developer which allow him to have a version of the code localy, make changes on it and update the original version.


1. Git clone:
 Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example).
 In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.
 
2. Git add: When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and wonâ€™t be included
 in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).

3. Git commit: This is maybe the most-used command of Git. Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to
 save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).

4. Git push: After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server.
 Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.
