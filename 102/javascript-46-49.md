# writing a SCRIPT for a web page 

## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
   Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Where possible, aim to keep the three languages
in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files. Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to 
right. builds on the previous one.

These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.As more and more web-enabled devices come onto the market,
this concept is becoming more widely adopted.It's not just screen sizes that are varied - connection speeds and capabilities of each device can also differ.

## basic javascript instructions

### STATEMENTS:

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with
 a semicolon.notes that :

1. Each of the lines of code in green is a statement.
2. The pink curly braces indicate the start and endof a code block. (Each code block could contain many more statements.)
3. JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE.
2. STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE.
3. STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS. 


### COMMENTS:

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
like:
 
1./* Th i s script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time. It is an example from JavaScript & jQuer y book */  (mulyi line comments)
2. // Create a ne1~ dat e object (one line comment)



### VARIABLES:
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. The use of variables to 
represent numbers or other kinds of data .



### WOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES:

to use a variable , you need to announce that you want to use it.this involves creating a variable and giving it a name 



### HOE TO ASSAIGN THEM A VALUE :

In JS the equal sign (=) is an assignment operater, it says that you are going to assign a value to the  variable ( X = 4;).

### DATA TYPES:

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 

1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE :
For tasks that involve counting or calculating sums, you will use numbers 0-9 (22).

2. STRING DATA TYPE:
The strings data type consists ofletters and other characters.('yooyoo').

3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.
