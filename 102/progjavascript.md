# javaScript 

## Intro:

JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
You can use JavaScript to select anyelement, attribute, or text from an HTML page, and to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them, specify a set 
of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. You can specify that a script should run when a specific 
event has occurred and it could be run like : • A button is pressed. • A link is clicked (or tapped) on. • A cursor hovers over an element.

## WHAT IS A SCRIPT:
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step. A browser may
use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation 
around them.

## WRITING A SCRIPT:

To write a script, you need to firststate your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.

3: CODE EACH STEP 
Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 


1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE:
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value and its donr by using equal operater (var theTall = 50; ).

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE:
You can perform operations on any number ofindividual values to determine asingle value (var area = 3 * 2;).

## OPERATORS:

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : color = 'beige'; 

* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS : area = 3 * 2;

* STRING OPERATORS : greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';

* COMPARISON OPERATORS : buy = 3 > 5; 

*LOGICAL OPERATORS : buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 



### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS :

    name            sign           purpose
1. ADDITION          +          Adds one value to another

2. SUBTRACTION       -          One value from another 

3. DIVISION          /          Divides two values

4. MULTIPLICATION    *          Multiplies two values using an asterisk

5. INCREMENT        ++         Adds one to the current number

6. DECREMENT        --        Subtracts one from the current number

7. MODULUS          %         Divides two values and returns the remainde




## STRING OPERATOR:

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it, There are many occasions where you may need to join two or
more strings to create a single value. Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation.

 example 1                                                  example 2     
var costl = '7';                                        var  number = 12   ;                                
var cost2 = '9 ' ;                                      var  street = 'Ivy road '  ;                           
var total = costl + cost2;                              var  add = number + street ;                          
                                                                         
You would end up with a string                       You would end up with a string
   saying '79'.                                           saying '12Ivy Road' .                                                              




## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the 
function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code. Furthermore, the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the steps Ineeded to achieve a task. The script can then ask the function, to perform all of those steps as and when they are required.



## DECLARING A FUNCTION
 To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.
This function is very basic (it only contains one statement), but it illustrates how to write a function. Most functions that you will see or write are likely to consist
of more statements.The point to remember is that functions store the code required to perform a specific task, and that the script can ask the function to perform that task whenever needed.

## CALLING A FUNCTION
 Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function
