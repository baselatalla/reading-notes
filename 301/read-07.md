# Roy Fielding

Who write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser like HTTP.

## HTTP :

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.

That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing .it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. it its like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information..

## REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTPز It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. Such a Web service must provide its Web resources in a textual representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations. This approach allows interoperability between the computer systems on the Internet that provide these services
