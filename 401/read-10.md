## Stacks and Queues:


### Stacks:
**stacks** is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.


### Stacks Operations:
- ``push()`` − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.
- ``pop()`` − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack. 
- ``peek()`` − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
- ``isFull()`` − check if stack is full.
- ``isEmpty()`` − check if stack is empty or not.
  

#### FILO
**First In Last Out(FILO):** This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

#### LIFO :
**Last In First Out(LIFO)** This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Queues:
**Queue** is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

### Queues operations:
- **Enqueue:** a new element in a queue is inserted at the back of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** a elements that are removed from the queue.
- **Front:** get the top data element of the queue, without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** check if queue is empty or not.
- 
### FIFO:
**First In First Out(FIFO)** which mean that the first item added to the Queue will be the first item popped out of the Queue.

### LILO:
**Last In Last Out(LILO)** This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
