# JupyterLab

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. 

You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:

* `Code Consoles` provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

* `Kernel-backed` documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

* `Notebook` cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

* `Multiple views` of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.


JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. 

To navigate the user interface, JupyterLab offers customizable keyboard shortcuts and the ability to use key maps from vim, emacs, and Sublime Text in the text editor.

JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes, file editors, and custom components.

JupyterLab is served from the same server and uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.


# NumPy

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

**Numeric**, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.


**Operations using NumPy**

Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −

* Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

* Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

* Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.


**NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab** 

NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Mat−plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.

It is open source, which is an added advantage of NumPy.
