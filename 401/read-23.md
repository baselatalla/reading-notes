# Django Best Practices: Custom User Model

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up and so on see the Django Login and Logout tutorial for more.

However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

But how to implement one? The official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.


## Setup

To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
install Django
make a new Django project called config
make a new app accounts
start the local web server
Here are the commands to run:

```py
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver

```

Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

If you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 you‚Äôll see the Django welcome screen.

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work. Seriously, don't mess with it unless you really know what you're doing. And if you did, you wouldn't be reading this tutorial, would you?

So we'll use AbstractUser which actually subclasses AbstractBaseUser but provides more default configuration.

## Custom User Model

Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

update config/settings.py
create a new CustomUser model
create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
update the admin
In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We'll call our custom user model CustomUser.

Within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.

```py
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'accounts', # new
]
...
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser' # new
```

Now update accounts/models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```py 
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

```

We need new versions of two form methods that receive heavy use working with users. Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new file in the accounts app called forms.py.

`(accounts) $ touch accounts/forms.py`

We'll update it with the following code to largely subclass the existing forms.

```py 
# accounts/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('username', 'email')

class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('username', 'email')
```

Finally we update admin.py since the Admin is highly coupled to the default User model.

```py
# accounts/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['email', 'username',]

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)

```

And we're done! We can now run makemigrations and migrate for the first time to create a new database that uses the custom user model.

```py
(accounts) $ python manage.py makemigrations accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py migrate

```

## Superuser

It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.

`(accounts) $ python manage.py createsuperuser`

## üìñ Installation
DjangoX can be installed via Pip, Pipenv, or Docker depending upon your setup. To start, clone the repo to your local computer and change into the proper directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox.git
$ cd djangox
```

### Pip

```
$ python3 -m venv djangox
$ source djangox/bin/activate
(djangox) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(djangox) $ python manage.py migrate
(djangox) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
(djangox) $ python manage.py runserver
# Load the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Pipenv

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
(djangox) $ python manage.py migrate
(djangox) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
(djangox) $ python manage.py runserver
# Load the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Docker

```
$ docker build .
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
# Load the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

For Docker, the `INTERNAL_IPS` configuration in `config/settings.py` must be updated to the following:

```python
# config/settings.py
# django-debug-toolbar
import socket
hostname, _, ips = socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
INTERNAL_IPS = [ip[:-1] + "1" for ip in ips]
```

## Setup

```
# Run Migrations
(djangox) $ python manage.py migrate

# Create a Superuser
(djangox) $ python manage.py createsuperuser

# Confirm everything is working:
(djangox) $ python manage.py runserver

# Load the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000
