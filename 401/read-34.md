# Django Settings Best Practices

## Managing Django Settings: Issues

**Different environments.** Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, some mocked data, etc). You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.
**Sensitive data.** You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.
**Sharing settings between team members.** You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings. For example, a developer may add a third-party app or some API integration and fail to add specific settings. On large (or even mid-size) projects, this can cause real issues.
**Django settings are a Python code.** This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, ```settings.py``` can have a very tricky logic.

## Setting Configuration: Different Approaches

There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best. Let's take a brief look at the most popular ones to examine their weaknesses and strengths.

## 12 Factors

12 Factors is a collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web-apps that will be easy to deploy and scale in the Cloud. It was created by Heroku, a well-known Cloud hosting provider.
The collection consists of twelve parts:

1. Codebase
2. Dependencies
3. Config
4. Backing services
5. Build, release, run
6. Processes
7. Port binding
8. Concurrency
9. Disposability
10. Dev/prod parity
11. Logs
12. Admin processes
Each point describes a recommended way to implement a specific aspect of the project. Some of these points are covered by instruments like Django, Python, pip. Some are covered by design patterns or the infrastructure setup. In the context of this article, we are interested in one part: the Configuration.
The Settings file is a small but very important part of any Django project. If you do it wrong, you'll have a lot of issues during all phases of development. But if you do it right, it will be a good basis for your project that will allow it to grow and scale in the future.
Using the environment variables approach, you can easily switch from a monolith to microservice architecture, wrap your project in Docker containers, and deploy it in any VPS or Cloud hosting platform such as: Amazon, Google Cloud, or your own Kubernetes cluster.

## [SSH Tutorial](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)

## What is SSH

**SSH, or Secure Shell, is** a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

## Understanding Different Encryption Techniques

The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client. Host refers to the remote server you are trying to access, while the client is the computer you are using to access the host. **There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:**

1. Symmetrical encryption
    - Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, any one possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.
2. Asymmetrical encryption
   - Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.
3. Hashing
   - One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse.

## How Does SSH Work with These Encryption Techniques

The way SSH works is by making use of a client-server model to allow for authentication of two remote systems and encryption of the data that passes between them.
SSH operates on TCP port 22 by default (though this can be changed if needed). The host (server) listens on port 22 (or any other SSH assigned port) for incoming connections. It organizes the secure connection by authenticating the client and opening the correct shell environment if the verification is successful.
The client must begin the SSH connection by initiating the TCP handshake with the server, ensuring a secured symmetric connection, verifying whether the identity displayed by the server match previous records (typically recorded in an RSA key store file), and presenting the required user credentials to authenticate the connection.
There are two stages to establishing a connection: first both the systems must agree upon encryption standards to protect future communications, and second, the user must authenticate themselves. If the credentials match, then the user is granted access.

## Session Encryption Negotiation

When a client tries to connect to the server via TCP, the server presents the encryption protocols and respective versions that it supports. If the client has a similar matching pair of protocol and version, an agreement is reached and the connection is started with the accepted protocol. The server also uses an asymmetric public key which the client can use to verify the authenticity of the host.
Once this is established, the two parties use what is known as a Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm to create a symmetrical key. This algorithm allows both the client and the server to arrive at a shared encryption key which will be used henceforth to encrypt the entire communication session.
Here is how the algorithm works at a very basic level:

1. Both the client and the server agree on a very large prime number, which of course does not have any factor in common. This prime number value is also known as the seed value.
2. Next, the two parties agree on a common encryption mechanism to generate another set of values by manipulating the seed values in a specific algorithmic manner. These mechanisms, also known as encryption generators, perform large operations on the seed. An example of such a generator is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
3. Both the parties independently generate another prime number. This is used as a secret private key for the interaction.
4. This newly generated private key, with the shared number and encryption algorithm (e.g. AES), is used to compute a public key which is distributed to the other computer.
5. The parties then use their personal private key, the other machine's shared public key and the original prime number to create a final shared key. This key is independently computed by both computers but will create the same encryption key on both sides.
6. Now that both sides have a shared key, they can symmetrically encrypt the entire SSH session. The same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages (read: section on symmetrical encryption).

## Authenticating the User

The final stage before the user is granted access to the server is authenticating his/her credentials. For this, most SSH users use a password. The user is asked to enter the username, followed by the password. These credentials securely pass through the symmetrically encrypted tunnel, so there is no chance of them being captured by a third party.
Although passwords are encrypted, it is still not recommended to use passwords for secure connections. This is because many bots can simply brute force easy or default passwords and gain access to your account. Instead, the recommended alternative is SSH Key Pairs.
These are a set of asymmetric keys used to authenticate the user without the need of inputting any password.
