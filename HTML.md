## PROCESS & DESIGN

   In the process of creating a new web site there are many aspects to look after which come up as a questions that put the headlines and help to organize the process.Starting with *How is the audienes?*  what is there age range, gender, location, income, hours on web, etc... which that help to understand who your target audience is. Then *Why to visit * you need to consider why they are coming and your content and design should be influenced by the goals and motivations of your users. * what the vistors need * First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site, then you know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.


### Site Maps

   The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site
  map and it will show how those pages can be grouped. that help you decide what information should go on each 
  page, you can use a technique called card sorting.
  
  ### WireFrames

     A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a
  site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. You can use grouping and
similarity to help simplify the information you present.


# Structure

HTML p XX ages are text documents.HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.Tags are often referred 
to as elements.Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the 
closing tag denotes the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that 
element. Attributes require a name and a value. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you
to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Layout 

  "<div>" elements are often used as containing elementsto group together sections of a page.Browsers display
pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. The float property moves 
content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items 
require a defined width.) Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. Designers keep pages within
 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its 
 relevance without scrolling). Grids help create professional and flexible designs. CSS Frameworks provide 
 rules for common tasks. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


 # HTML5 Layout 

   The new HTML5 indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements). Older browsers that do 
not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. To make HTML5 elements 
work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed.
