## 1. Text Editor:
   Programming or coding are based on typing words, letters, numbers, characters; basically texts!
And what allows us to write and manage a texts is a software called a  "Text Editor". 
There are so many text editors for many purposes as well, some of it comes with the operation
System {Notpad, MS Word, ..} and others can be download from the internet {Brackets, Coda 2,..}.

Coding using normal text editors are difficult so they came up with editors called code editors 
Which is may be a stand-alone program or part of an integrated development environment (IDE). 
They make writing and reading the source code easier by differentiating the elements and routines
so programmers can more easily look at their code.

Code editors are designed specially to make coding easy by providing it with many features,
some of the most important features are:
1. Code completion.
2. Syntax highlighting.
3. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain andfatigue).
4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.


## Command line:

   A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. allows you to push, fetch, edite, add, 
explore data and files in your system by enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given 
to you similarly as text. The terminal are common software between all opration systems and within the terminal 
there is what called shell which is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and 
looks after running (or executing) commands, the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell.

Linux terminal is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier,which get you moving around the system
such as:

1. pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
2. ls: List the contents of a directory.
3. cd: Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
4. file: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
5. ls -a: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

And there something to keep in mind that:

* Everything is a file under, Linux Even directories.
* Linux is an extensionless, system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux is case sensitive, Beware of silly typos.
