# How The Computer Work 

   whether you are judt curious about the devices you see every day or you want to design the innovations of the future you have to knew _How computer Works._  


## What Makes Computer A Computer


   computers are every where, they are in people's poket's, car's, on there wrists, etc.. it's help humans in the thinking work. But what makes computer A Computer is 
that it had preforme four different tasks which are common to all computers:

1. Take *** Inputs ***:
   Is the stuff that the world does or that you do that makes the computer do stuff.

2. *** Store *** information:
      Inputs give computer information, which is then stored in memory.

3. *** Processing the *** information:
      A computer's processor takes information from the memory, It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm,And then it sends the processed
 information back to be stored in memory again.This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.

4. *** Output *** the result.
      How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do.A computer display can show text, photos, videos,
 or interactive games, even virtual reality!



## How it Works 

    computer worhs on ones and zeros But almost nobody today actually deals directly with these ones and zeros. But ones and zeroes do play 
a big role in how computers work on the inside. Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.
How do you store or represent information using electricity? Well, if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it, the signal 
could either be on or off. With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true or fales a one or zero, or any thing else with only two optinos.
This on/off state of a single wire is called a bit,and it's the smallest piece of information a computer can store.If you use more wires you get
more bits: more ones and zeros.With more bits you can represent more complex information.But to understand that, we need to learn about something 
called the binary number system which is  a system that have just tow digit 0,1 that we can represnt vedios, images, voices in.



# Circuits and Logic

  Every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information, which can be represented by on or off electrical signals
In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to make the information that is output, a computer needs to modify and
combine the input signals. To do this, a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits.
  
  
#CPU, Memory, Input & Output

### CPU :The central processing unit comes in action when the input has been recorded through input unit. The central processing unit is responsible
 for actual processing of inputs to generate the output. The central processing unit (CPU) is considered as the brain of the computer.
 It is also called as Microprocessor. This device converts all the supplied input into output as per the instructions supplied by the user. 
The CPU of a computer is the device on which the speed and efficiency  of the computer mainly depends on.

### Memory: 
The memory unit is one of the most important sections of computer. It is responsible for storing the data and instructions either temporarily or permanently.
 This is the section due to which the computer can store and remember thousands of different files of various types. The memory is the storage area where all 
the inputs are stored before processing and the outputs are stored after processing of inputs. Many devices provide input to computer and a space is required 
to store and queue all these inputs, before they are processed by the CPU. This is because these inputs are to be processed one by one


### Input & Output:

Data and instructions must enter a computer system before the computer can perform any computation on the supplied data. The input unit that links a computer with
its external environment performs this task. Data and instructions enter a computer through an input unit in a form that depends upon the input device used.

An output unit performs the reverse operation of that of an input unit. It supplies information obtained from data processing to outside world. Hence, it links
a computer with its external environment.



# Hardware and Software 
  Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer’s hard drive. For instance, the computer monitor you’re currently using to read this text and the mouse you’re using to navigate this web page is computer hardware. The Internet browser that allowed you to visit this page and the operating system that the
 browser is running on is considered software.
